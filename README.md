# viimote

**Download**: https://github.com/xerpi/viimote/releases

**Enable the plugin:**

* Add viimote.skprx to taiHEN's config (ux0:/tai/config.txt):
	```
	*KERNEL
	ux0:tai/viimote.skprx
	```
* You need to refresh the config.txt by rebooting or through VitaShell.

**First time using it (aka pairing):**
1. Go to Setting -> Devices -> Bluetooth Devices
2. Press 1+2 (SYNC won't work) on the Wiimote during 2 seconds
3. The Wiimote will pair and connect automatically (don't press over it when it appears)

**Using it after pairing it:**
1. You simply need to *press any button* (instead of pressing 1+2) to connect it to the Vita.

**Supported extensions:**
* Nunchuk
* Classic Controller

**Note**: If you use Mai, don't put the plugin inside ux0:/plugins because Mai will load all stuff you put in there...
